## Portfolio Highlights

# Software Development Architect
    - Highly Passionate Software Architect/Development Craftsman
    - High energy avid learner always in the pursuit of learning and creating best practices
    - Extremely hard working and committed to coming up with plugable solutions that follow SOLID principles
    - Fully aware that while I know a lot there is always much more to learn and improve upon
    - Stand up for the team as a whole and believe that the team dynamic is of utmost importance
    - Do not over architect
      - Things change once you start implementing and learn more through more detailed research
      - Break things down into smaller pieces and provide detailed todo list where possible
      - Be careful with attempting to make decision that can be left for later as you will find that you will be better placed to make better judgements with you and the team future self
    - Only decide on what you know now and leave the unknown for later when you have more knowledge
    - Promote vertical slices of work
      - Needs to include detailed wire frames collaborated with the whole team and not just the PO (product owner)
      - Development team needs to take ownership of the product and should be given responsibility and feel empowered if they want to grasp the opportunity
      - Fail fast and get feedback from your customers early to make sure we are going in the right direction and make them realize we here to listen and consider their feedback


## Communicability
      - Confident in coming up with solutions to hard problems and more than willing to put in the work to communicaate solutions that is palatable for business and fellow developers
      - I try to come into conversations in good faith and feel it is important for everyone to have their say and have often found that hard conversations are needed in order for a team to go from from forming, storming into performing
      - Things should be talked out as a team until the majority of the team reach consensus or in rare cases where the manager has to make a decision and as a team we should stick to that decision unless something comes up that questions the decision.
      - I undertook the following responsibility:
      - Lead by example:
        - Work towards continous improvement through refactoring and new learnings.
        - The only way I found the ability to at times make radical refactorings based on new knowledge has been completely down to excellent API and especially UI tests against each business requirement
      - Lead by example from a technical and personal point of view
        - Each stack has been developed looking at best practice out there and coming up with even solutions exemplified esp. React & Redux + Rematch
